# Metrik – On-Chain Credit Settlement Infrastructure for Supply Chains

Metrik is a decentralized credit infrastructure that bridges traditional B2B trade credit with on-chain liquidity. It enables suppliers to tokenize their unpaid invoices as expirable NFTs and borrow against them using liquidity sourced from the crypto ecosystem — offering faster capital access without relying on banks.

---

🔍 **Problem**

In traditional B2B transactions, buyers often purchase goods or services on credit, delaying payments for 30–90 days. This leaves suppliers — especially early-stage or SME vendors — cash-strapped and unable to grow due to working capital shortages. Banks are slow, underwrite conservatively, and charge high interest for such short-term loans.

💡 **Solution**

Metrik creates an alternative, on-chain credit market by:

- Allowing suppliers to mint Invoice NFTs representing verified, pending receivables
- Letting suppliers borrow stablecoins against these invoices
- Rewarding lenders (crypto users) with interest + METRIK token incentives
- Enforcing smart contract–driven collateralization and liquidation mechanisms

⚙️ **How It Works**

- **Invoice Tokenization** – Suppliers create expirable, verifiable NFTs representing invoices.
- **Staking & Trust Scoring** – Suppliers stake $METRIK tokens to earn trust tiers, which define borrowing limits.
- **Dynamic LTV Engine** – Metrik calculates borrowing capacity using on-chain staking, tier, and credit history.
- **Liquidity Matching** – Liquidity providers deposit MUSD into pools and earn APR from borrowing activity.
- **Repayment or Liquidation** – Borrowers repay with interest; if overdue, NFTs are burned and staked tokens are slashed.

🔐 **Key Features**

✅ Invoice-backed borrowing using NFTs  
✅ Dynamic credit scoring via staking + history  
✅ On-chain invoice verification using AVS or trusted oracles  
✅ Fair, transparent, and programmatic interest rates  
✅ Zero human underwriting or intermediaries  
✅ Crypto-native access to real-world working capital demand

🎯 **Target Users**

- **Suppliers/Vendors:** Seeking faster liquidity against trade receivables
- **Liquidity Providers:** Holding idle MUSD, seeking yield with real-world collateral
- **DAOs/Protocols:** With treasury capital looking to support RWAs
- **SMEs in emerging markets** excluded by traditional finance

💰 **Token Utility – $METRIK**

- Staking determines credit tiers (Bronze → Diamond)
- Higher staking unlocks better borrowing terms
- Slashed on borrower defaults
- Earned by LPs and verifier/integrators as incentives

## Overview

Metrik enables suppliers to:
- Mint invoices as NFTs (`InvoiceNFT`)
- Stake METRIK tokens for higher borrowing power and rewards
- Borrow stablecoins against verified invoices
- Earn rewards as a liquidity provider (LP) or staker

---

## Architecture

- **InvoiceNFT**: ERC721 tokens representing invoices, with verification and metadata.
- **LendingPool**: Manages stablecoin deposits, loans, repayments, and liquidations.
- **Staking**: Users stake METRIK tokens for tiered benefits and claimable rewards.
- **BorrowRegistry**: Tracks supplier credit history for risk management.
- **MockERC20**: Used for METRIK and MUSD tokens (mintable/burnable for testing).

---

## Smart Contracts

### MockERC20 (METRIK, MUSD)
- ERC20 tokens with custom decimals.
- `mint(address, amount)` and `burn(amount)` functions (owner-only for mint).
- Used for both METRIK (18 decimals) and MUSD.

### InvoiceNFT
- ERC721 NFT for each invoice.
- Metadata: invoiceId, supplier, buyer, creditAmount, dueDate, IPFS hash, verification status.
- Only verified invoices can be transferred or used as collateral.
- Roles: `MINTER_ROLE`, `VERIFIER_ROLE`.

### Staking
- Stake METRIK tokens for 45, 90, 180, or 365 days.
- Tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond (based on points).
- APY: 1%–8% depending on duration.
- **Claimable rewards**: Users can claim METRIK rewards based on APY and time staked.
- Rewards are auto-claimed on unstake.

### LendingPool
- Deposit/withdraw stablecoins as LP.
- Borrow against verified invoices (up to 60% LTV, tier-boosted).
- Repay with interest, subject to origination fees.
- Liquidate overdue loans, with loss absorption logic.
- System-wide and per-user safe lending limits.
- Integrates with Staking and BorrowRegistry.

### BorrowRegistry
- Tracks supplier defaults, late repayments, and successful loans.
- Used by LendingPool to adjust borrowing capacity (LTV).

---

## Staking & Rewards

- **Staking**: Lock METRIK tokens for a fixed duration to earn points and APY.
- **Claiming Rewards**: Call `claimRewards(stakeIndex)` to mint earned METRIK tokens.
- **Auto-claim**: Rewards are automatically claimed when unstaking.
- **View rewards**: Use `pendingRewards(address, stakeIndex)` to see unclaimed rewards.

---

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+ (avoid v23+ for Hardhat compatibility)
- npm
- Hardhat

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file:
   ```
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
   INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_key
   ```

### Supported Networks

- Hardhat (local)
- Sepolia (Ethereum testnet)
- Fuji (Mezo testnet)
- Mezo (OP Stack testnet)

#### Example Mezo Network Config (from `hardhat.config.ts`):
```js
: {
  url: "https://rpc.test.mezo.org",
  chainId: 31611,
  timeout: 60000,
  accounts: [
    process.env.PRIVATE_KEY_OWNER || "",
    process.env.PRIVATE_KEY_SUPPLIER || "",
    process.env.PRIVATE_KEY_LP || "",
    process.env.PRIVATE_KEY_BUYER || ""
  ].filter(key => key !== "")
}
```

### Deploying to Mezo

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network MezoTestnet
```

Deployment addresses will be saved to `deployments/MezoTestnet.json`.
